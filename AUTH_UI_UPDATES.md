## Summary
Updated the homepage and dashboard headers to properly show authentication state and provide sign-up options.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. **Homepage Header (`app/page.tsx`)**

#### Before:
- Always showed "Sign In" button regardless of authentication state
- No indication if user was logged in
- No sign-up button in header

#### After:
- ✅ **When Signed In:**
  - Shows user's email address (hidden on small screens)
  - Shows "Sign Out" button with logout icon
  - Clicking Sign Out logs user out and refreshes page

- ✅ **When Not Signed In:**
  - Shows "Sign Up" button (outline style)
  - Shows "Sign In" button (default style)
  - Both buttons link to respective auth pages

- ✅ **Loading State:**
  - Shows animated skeleton while checking auth status
  - Prevents layout shift

#### Technical Changes:
- Converted from server component to client component (`"use client"`)
- Added authentication state management with `useState`
- Added `useEffect` to check user on mount
- Integrated Supabase auth checking
- Added `handleSignOut` function

---

### 2. **Dashboard Header (`app/dashboard/page.tsx`)**

#### Before:
- Only showed "Sign In" button when not authenticated

#### After:
- ✅ **When Not Signed In:**
  - Shows "Sign Up" button (outline style)
  - Shows "Sign In" button with icon (default style)
  - Both buttons visible side-by-side

#### Technical Changes:
- Added Sign Up button link to `/auth/signup`
- Maintained existing Sign In functionality
- Consistent styling with homepage

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Clear Authentication Status**: Users can immediately see if they're logged in
2. **Easy Sign Out**: One-click logout from homepage
3. **Sign Up Visibility**: Sign-up option always visible when not authenticated
4. **Responsive Design**: Email hidden on mobile to save space
5. **Smooth Loading**: No jarring layout shifts during auth check

## Visual Layout

### Homepage Header (Not Signed In)
```
[CodeCoach Logo] [Theme Toggle] [Sign Up] [Sign In]
```

### Homepage Header (Signed In)
```
[CodeCoach Logo] [Theme Toggle] [user@email.com] [Sign Out]
```

### Dashboard Header (Not Signed In)
```
[CodeCoach] [Home] ... [Theme Toggle] [Sign Up] [Sign In]
```

### Dashboard Header (Signed In)
```
[CodeCoach] [Home] ... [user@email.com] [Theme Toggle] [Sign Out Icon]
```

## Button Styling

- **Sign Up**: `variant="outline"` - Secondary action, less prominent
- **Sign In**: `variant="default"` - Primary action, more prominent
- **Sign Out**: `variant="outline"` (homepage), `variant="ghost"` with icon (dashboard)

---

## Responsive Behavior

### Mobile (< 640px)
- Email address hidden (`hidden sm:inline`)
- Buttons remain visible
- Compact layout

### Desktop (≥ 640px)
- Email address visible
- All elements displayed
- Comfortable spacing

## Code Quality

### Best Practices Applied:
- ✅ Proper loading states

- ✅ Consistent styling
- ✅ Semantic HTML
- ✅ Accessibility (proper button labels)
- ✅ Type safety (TypeScript)

### Performance:
- ✅ Minimal re-renders
- ✅ Efficient auth checking
- ✅ No unnecessary API calls
- ✅ Smooth transitions
