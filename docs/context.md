# \## Project Breakdown

# 

# \### App Name

# 

# CodeCoach

# 

# \### Platform

# 

# Web

# 

# \### Summary

# 

# CodeCoach is a web application designed to assist developers in deciphering unfamiliar code. By providing contextual, in-line comments, CodeCoach aims to accelerate learning and reduce the time spent on understanding complex code bases. The application's goal is to enhance coding skills, especially when transitioning between different programming languages.

# 

# \### Primary Use Case

# 

# The primary use case for CodeCoach is developers seeking assistance in comprehending existing codebases. It benefits both learners of new programming languages and seasoned developers confronted with unfamiliar syntax or logic.

# 

# \### Authentication Requirements

# 

# Users must sign in to utilize CodeCoach's features. The platform will employ Supabase for secure user authentication, allowing seamless access and personalization, such as saving preferences for complexity levels and programming languages.

# 

# \## Tech Stack Overview

# 

# \* \*\*Frontend Framework:\*\* React + Next.js

# \* \*\*UI Library:\*\* Tailwind CSS + ShadCN

# \* \*\*Backend (BaaS):\*\* Supabase (Handling authentication, database, and edge functions)

# \* \*\*AI Integration:\*\* DeepSeek API (via OpenRouter)

# \* \*\*Deployment:\*\* Vercel

# 

# \## Core Features

# 

# \### Code Analysis \& Comment Generation

# 

# \* Automatically detects the programming language of the input code.

# \* Generates in-line comments based on the selected complexity level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced).

# \* Powered by DeepSeek models through OpenRouter for intelligent code understanding.

# 

# \### Code Language Conversion

# 

# \* Identifies the programming language of the input code.

# \* Allows users to convert code into another language using DeepSeek's language understanding capabilities.

# 

# \## Prompt Engineering Guidelines

# 

# \### Code Analysis Prompts

# 

# Structure prompts to DeepSeek based on complexity level:

# 

# \*\*Beginner Level:\*\*

# ```

# Analyze the following code and add inline comments that explain:

# \- What each line or block of code does in simple terms

# \- The purpose of variables and functions

# \- Basic concepts being used

# Keep explanations clear and accessible for someone new to programming.

# 

# Code:

# \[USER\_CODE]

# ```

# 

# \*\*Intermediate Level:\*\*

# ```

# Analyze the following code and add inline comments that explain:

# \- The logic and flow of the code

# \- Design patterns or techniques being used

# \- Why certain approaches were chosen

# \- Potential edge cases or considerations

# Assume the reader has basic programming knowledge.

# 

# Code:

# \[USER\_CODE]

# ```

# 

# \*\*Advanced Level:\*\*

# ```

# Analyze the following code and add inline comments that explain:

# \- Performance implications and optimizations

# \- Advanced patterns, algorithms, or architectural decisions

# \- Trade-offs and alternative approaches

# \- Integration points and dependencies

# Keep comments concise and focus on non-obvious implementation details.

# 

# Code:

# \[USER\_CODE]

# ```

# 

# \### Code Conversion Prompts

# 

# ```

# Convert the following \[SOURCE\_LANGUAGE] code to \[TARGET\_LANGUAGE].

# Preserve the logic and functionality while following \[TARGET\_LANGUAGE] best practices and idiomatic patterns.

# Add brief comments explaining any significant changes in approach due to language differences.

# 

# Source Code:

# \[USER\_CODE]

# ```

# 

# \### Response Format Guidelines

# 

# Instruct DeepSeek to return code with comments in the following format:

# \- Inline comments should be placed above or beside the relevant code line

# \- Use the appropriate comment syntax for the target language

# \- Maintain original code formatting and indentation

# \- For conversion, return only the converted code with explanatory comments

# 

# \## Code Editor Component

# 

# \* \*\*Syntax Highlighting:\*\* Implement Monaco Editor (the same editor that powers VS Code) for professional-grade syntax highlighting and code editing experience.

# \* \*\*Features:\*\*

# &nbsp; \* Multi-language support with automatic language detection

# &nbsp; \* Line numbers and code folding

# &nbsp; \* Theme support (light/dark mode compatible)

# &nbsp; \* Copy the analyzed/converted code as plain text with all comments included

# \* \*\*Format:\*\* 

# &nbsp; \* Plain text format that preserves formatting, indentation, and comments

# &nbsp; \* Ready to paste directly into any code editor or IDE

# &nbsp; \* No additional formatting or metadata - just clean, usable code

# \* \*\*UX Considerations:\*\*

# &nbsp; \* Prominent copy button placement near the output area

# &nbsp; \* Keyboard shortcut support (Ctrl/Cmd + C when output is focused)

# &nbsp; \* Clear visual indication of what will be copied

#
